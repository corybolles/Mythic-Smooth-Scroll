Smooth scrolling plugin with optional offset for fixed/sticky headers.

== Description ==
The Mythic Smooth Scroll plugin is a very lightweight jQuery plugin for adding smooth scrolling animations on single-page websites or on longer posts with various anchors.

The plugin features an optional offset for fixed/sticky headers to make sure it always scrolls beneath the content, as well as an adjustable manual offset amount to determine how far from the header/top of the screen the content will land when scrolled to.

== Installation ==
Click activate, and enjoy! The plugin will function for any links that go to a spot on the same page. You can adjust the plugin settings under the Settings > Mythic Smooth Scroll tab.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
How do I find my header\'s ID?

Your header\'s ID can be found by right-clicking it on your website, and selecting \"inspect\" or \"inspect element\", depending on your browser. This will open your browser\'s element inspector, which will display a list of your page\'s source code elements. Simply look for the \"header\" element, and copy the content that appears after id= (not including the quotes).
